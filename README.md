Introduction
============

This is a version of the wedding program I designed for my wedding in LaTeX,
with copyright-infringing material like music removed and all names changed to
protect privacy. It took a lot of work and I'm really proud of it, so I'm happy
to let anyone else use and modify it!

The Makefile should build things if you have TeX Live and lilypond installed on
a Linux system; I don't know about other platforms. I'm happy to answer any
questions.

I've included the PDF as it builds on my system so you can see how it looks if
you have build issues.

Printing
========

We used smartpress.com for our printing and would recommend them. Here are the
relevant details for our booklet printing:

Cover Stock: Linen - White
Cover Weight: 70# Text
Interior Pages Stock: Uncoated Smooth
Interior Pages Weight: 80# Text
Cover printing, outside: Full Color
Cover printing, inside: None
Pages Printing: Full Color
Finished Size in Inches (W x H): 5.5 x 8.5
Binding: Saddle Stitch

With the original music and some blank filler pages, our program came out to 16
pages (including covers). You'll want a multiple of 4 for a proper printing.

Music
=====

The actual music itself has been replaced with dummy music, which causes the
spacing issues you might notice. We used OneLicense.net for most of our
licensing issues and LicenSing for one other (I think it was the Servant Song).

We used the Mass of Creation music for most standard parts, and the Gregorian
version of the Our Father (which I've also heard called the Robert Snow version;
not sure which is technically correct).

If you can find a full copy of the Roman Missal, it has music for most of the
standard songs.

Fonts
=====

We used Edwardian Script for the calligraphy parts, but since that has a more
restricted copyright, I've changed that here to use the calligra package.

The divider decoration came from the wmdividers1 font, found here:
